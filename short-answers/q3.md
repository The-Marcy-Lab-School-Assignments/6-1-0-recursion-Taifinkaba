# Question

What are the benefits of writing functions recursively? What are the drawbacks?

# Answer
Some benefits of writing functions recursively are: reduces time complexity, elegant and concise code, and simplifies complex problems. Some drawbacks include: taking up a lot of memory, can be inefficient and consume space on the call stack, risk of stack overflow if not handled properly, and recursive solutions can sometimes be confusing.
