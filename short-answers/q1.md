# Question

What is a recursive function? What are "cases" that exist in recursive functions?

# Answer
recursive function is when a function loops itself till it meets the base case. The cases are: base case that it needs to fail and a way for the program to loop itself.

Great answer! However, "base case that it needs to fail" is kind of vague and unclear, please explain further.
