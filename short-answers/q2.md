# Question

What type of problems are best solved using recursion?

# Answer
Counting stuff is best for recursion, like a list or line. Tracking with numbers, and the fibonacci sequence is also the best of problems for them.

2/3 Points

Great examples and you're definitely on the right track! However, think about the common factor in these examples. Problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar problems are especially well-suited for recursion. Can you see how counting elements in a list or calculating Fibonacci numbers fit this pattern?
